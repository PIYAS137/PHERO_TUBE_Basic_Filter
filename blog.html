            scope of

                <p class="p-3 flex-1"><span class="text-3xl font-bold">Var : </span> First fo all var can access from
                    anywhere!
                    I can access it outside a function and also inside a function. I can reassign var. Var is best for
                    rough initialization but it can not handle the type related operations! Thats why var is use in
                    BASIC (vanilla js) but in higher level we should not use the var in big project or complex codin!
                    Var is a type of variable from ES5, in ES6, var is totally avoid , because in execution context var
                    is not suitable! So var scope is not preferable for large project!</p>

                <p class="flex-1 p-3"><span class="text-3xl font-bold">Let : </span> Let is a very scopable type in js!
                    let is most preferable for execution context. Because in scope control we can easily use let. for in
                    this case here x is declare in outside the function so, now x is become global! but in the function
                    of tempFunc(), we can access y inside the funciton because the scope of y is just the area of
                    funciton . so we can not access y outside the funcion! So thats why let is a very useful and most
                    used execution context in js. Also let is use for large and complex project!</p>

                <p class="flex-1 p-3"><span class="text-3xl font-bold">Const : </span>Const is same as var. as i say.
                    but the main advantage of and also disadvantage of const is , it cant reassignable ! I said
                    advantage and disadvantage both because for advantage, const is easy for execution context control,
                    type control, if we mistakely reassign a var that we dont want, const is useful in this term! const
                    is easy for control because it is act like constant ! but the disadvantage of const is we can not
                    reassign it. But funally const is so powerful and most used type. its have so many advantages but if
                    you know the right use of const then you will understand its advantages and then the disadvantages
                    of const become noting ! const is a member of ES6 !</p>

                            is a type of nothing! where undefined is type of not defined yet. But here null is a defined
                            value! In the code i say x is null. because i defined it to null. And Also we should to know
                            that null have its own data type ! its object! its a very interestin topic for me! and null
                            is a negative value !</p>

                <p>Suppose a URL : <img class="my-2" src="./blogImages/url.png" alt="">
                    here <span class="text-green-700 font-semibold">jsonplaceholdeer.typicode.com</span> is the url of
                    website. but the portion of this web is <span class="text-green-700 font-semibold">/user</span>. So
                    that API of the this web is stored in this portion. We can create 4 operation here, create, update,
                    read, delete. this all are go through the body of the API. An REST API is the rested data store, (In
                    my thinking). Here has so many data and if we want the operate with this data then we can with this
                    4 operation! REST API is one of the most popular thing nowadays! So that so many website provide it
                    with there complex benifits! REST or a simple API has some parts. There are HEAD, BODY, FOOT. BODY
                    always contain the data.
